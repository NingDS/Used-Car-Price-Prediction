# Used-Car-Price-Prediction
A machine-learning approach to predict used car price in Singapore
Probably the first predictive modelling for the used car market in Singapore! 
If you intend to sell a car in Singapore, you either sell it to a car dealer or list your car for sale on an online marketplace. 
Price quoted may vary greatly from car dealer to car dealer and also from one online marketplace to another. 
My model is able to predict up to 97% accuracy of the car price among the listings scraped from an established online car marketplace. 
Using the Streamlit application that I developed, car owners are now able to get a quote instantly and make an informed decision on how to sell their car.

Caveat: Cars above SGD 500,000 and brands such as Bentley, Rolls-Royce and Maybach are not included in the scope of this project. If you are fortunate enough to own this type of car, do work with a trustworthy car dealer to get a fair quote on your car.
